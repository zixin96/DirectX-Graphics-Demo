# DirectX 12 Graphics Playground

This repo servers as my DirectX 12 playground to try new ideas and rendering techniques. The initial framework comes from the book *Introduction to 3D Game Programming with DirectX 12 by Frank Luna*. This project also contains lots of modifications to the original framework and my solutions to most of the written and coding exercises in the book.
